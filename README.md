# Vulkan PBR ðŸŒ‹

An implementation of Physically Based Rendering (PBR), a technique that seeks to realistically simulate the interaction of light with materials. The scene illumination is done by using Image-Based Lighting (IBL), which uses high dynamic range (HDR) images of real-world environments to capture nuanced lighting conditions and enhance the realism of 3D object rendering.

### Features
* Skybox and mesh rendering.
* Offscreen rendering to generate a cubemap from an equirectangular HDR image.
* Offscreen rendering to generate both specular and diffuse maps.
* Compute shader to generate BRDF lookup table.
* Automatic runtime compilation from GLSL to SPIR-V for convenient development process.
