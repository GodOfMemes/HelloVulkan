# üåãHello EngineüññüèΩ

A real-time rendering engine using Vulkan.

### Features
* Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) with Cook-Torrance BRDF.
* Image-Based Lighting.
* Offscreen rendering to generate:
    * A cubemap from an equirectangular HDR image.
    * Specular and diffuse cubemaps.
    * Compute shader to generate BRDF lookup table.
* Reinhard tonemap postprocessing.
* Mesh loading and rendering.
* Multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA).
* Automatic runtime compilation from GLSL to SPIR-V.
* A simple abstraction layer that supports a sequence of render passes.
* Simple synchronization between compute queue and graphics queue.
* Minor features: Skybox, instancing with SSBOs, ImGui, UBOs, and push constants.

### Clustered Forward Shading

I finally implemented "Clustered Forward Shading" algorithm into my Vulkan engine. It's based on a tutorial written by [Angel Ortiz](https://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/21/CG.html). So far, it can render a scene with 1000 lights at 60-80 FPS using a 3060M graphics card.

The first step is to subdivide the view frustum into clusters.

The next step is light culling: for each cluster, I calculate the intersecting lights. This way, I can remove lights that are too far from the view frustum, leading to reduced light iteration inside the final fragment shader.

It's still a simplified implementation. The light culling part is obviously the bottleneck since each compute shader invocation performs intersection test in a brute-force manner. ü•µ
