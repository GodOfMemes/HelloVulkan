# Vulkan PBR ðŸŒ‹

An implementation of physically-based lighting model to generate realistic rendering in real time.

### Features
* Skybox and mesh rendering.
* Offscreen rendering to generate a cubemap from an equirectangular HDR image.
* Offscreen rendering to generate both specular and diffuse maps.
* Compute shader to generate BRDF lookup table.
* Automatic runtime compilation from GLSL to SPIR-V for convenient development process.
