# ðŸŒ‹Vulkan PBR+IBL

A Vulkan implementation of Physically Based Rendering (PBR), a technique that simulates the interaction of light with materials. The scene illumination is achieved through Image-Based Lighting (IBL), which utilizes HDR images to capture nuanced lighting conditions and enhance the realism of 3D object rendering.

### Features
* Cook-Torrance BRDF
* Offscreen rendering to generate:
    * A cubemap from an equirectangular HDR image
    * Specular and diffuse cubemaps
* Reinhard tonemap postprocessing
* glTF mesh rendering and skybox
* Multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) 
* Automatic runtime compilation from GLSL to SPIR-V
* Shader Storage Buffer Objects (SSBO), Uniform Buffer Objects (UBO), and Push Constants.
